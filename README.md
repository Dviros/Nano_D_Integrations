# Nano_D_Integrations
This repo is all about integrations revolving the amazing Binaris Nano_D++.

## What integrations are currently supported?
- Apple Music - macOS only

### What do we need to do?
- Setting your specific profile with 0 active actions from the keypad
- Downloading the profile.json and the python script, running it in a terminal using screen


### I want to help!
That's great! The script now allows dynamic execution using profile.json, meaning that everyone can modify and use the commands as they wish.
